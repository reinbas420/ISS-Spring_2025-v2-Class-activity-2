# Errors that I found

1. In the find_cube_pairs function,the target variable is not used but targ is not defined and used.<br>
2. The for loop does not contain the colon.<br>
3. Unnecessary semicolons in the code, as python does not contain semicolon in the syntax.<br>
4. The *** asterik does not work for finding cubes instead ** asterik works for exponentation.<br>
5. You have declared the pairs array for 1729 but u are printing for 1728.<br>
6. The printf should not be there as it should be print instead.<br>
7. In the find_cube_pairs use declare solutions and use sol list instead which is wrong<br>
8. In the print statement in the for a,b in pair it should be 3 inside of 2 for correct mathematical statement <br>
9. The function should be initialised by semicolon while writing it.<br>
